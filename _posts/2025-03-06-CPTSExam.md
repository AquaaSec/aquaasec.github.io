I recently obtained the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certification from Hack The Box, and boy, was it a journey. After three months of studying, I went from struggling to complete a single machine without write-ups to learning techniques such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), pivoting, Kerberoasting, and much more.

This certification was challenging but taught me a lot about the fundamentals of penetration testing, and I’m excited to move on to the next certification.

# Prerequisites
This certification isn’t one you can simply buy and take. It requires a few prerequisites, including completing the entire course content. Below, I’ve included a picture of the stats for the required course.

The course covers many topics, including Web Exploitation, Active Directory, Reporting, and Pivoting. I found it to be very practical, with numerous hands-on labs to reinforce the knowledge gained. Each topic is covered in depth, allowing students to understand not just how each tool works but also how each exploit functions.

The course goes beyond public proof-of-concept exploits by teaching students how to abuse common misconfigurations in various services. Additionally, it provides a thorough breakdown of Active Directory exploitation, helping students develop a strong understanding of common security weaknesses.

# The Exam
The exam was a daunting challenge, spanning 10 intense days. However, everything tested is thoroughly explained in the course. I personally dedicated around 10 hours a day to the exam and ended up finishing a day early.

This exam is very demanding, requiring students to go beyond public exploits and dive deep into misconfigurations, web exploitation, and Active Directory attacks.

A key component of the exam is the commercial-grade report, which must include an executive summary, a list of findings, remediation advice, and a remediation plan. The report is graded harshly, and many fail due to its quality alone. My report ended up being 100 pages long, though that included many screenshots.

# Final Thoughts
I highly recommend this course to anyone at a beginner-to-intermediate level, as it provides an in-depth understanding of penetration testing tools and techniques. The CPTS certification thoroughly prepares students for network penetration testing by covering both manual and automated exploitation.
