# **Hello!**

I started this blog in 2025 to share my research in the field of cybersecurity. I also intend to showcase any accomplishments or projects I may be working on.

I am a Cybersecurity Analyst and Student working on broading my knowledge within the field constantly seeking to learn more and share my experiences. Currently I hold the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certification and I am working on achieving more in the future.

Hopefully through this blog I will be able to clearly share my experiences and help someone else out.
